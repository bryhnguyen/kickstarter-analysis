# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns. 
## Overview of Project
In this project, Louise is a US-based playwright that is looking to budget for a crowdfunding campaign to fund production for their play. We have analyzed a dataset of Kickstart campaigns from multiple countries in which we observe the categories of campaigns, funding (goals and pledges), outcomes, and other key metrics. 
### Purpose
We want to identify factors that affect the successful outcomes of crowdfunding campaigns focused on plays.
## Analysis and Challenges
In the United States, we organized the dataset to identify the years that the campaigns started, the goal amount, pledged amount, and the outcome of these campaigns. Using line graphs we have visualized all US-based Kickstarter campaigns for plays and their outcomes based on the launch date and the goals. Possible challenges include outliers of campaigns that had very low or very high goals, cancelled projects, and projects without funding. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The outcomes of US-based Kickstarter campaigns for plays are displayed by the month the campaign started in a line chart. In May, we see the highest successful outcomes of these campaigns, whereas the highest failed outcomes have start dates in the month of October. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The outcomes of US-based Kickstarter campaigns for plays are displayed by their goal in a line chart. Campaigns with goals under $5000 saw the highest successful outcomes at over 70%. Campaigns with goals ranging from $20000 to $34999 saw the lowest mean successful outcome at 31%.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Possible challenges of this analysis can be the inclusion campaigns that are higher than Louise's projected $10,000 goal that are not relevant to Louise's planning. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Louise will want to lauch their campaign in the month of May to see a highest chance of success. Louise will also want to avoid the fall season (October in particuarl) to reduce the chance of a failed campaign. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Louise will want to limit the goal of her campaign to under $20,000 to keep the chance of their campaign succeding at 50% or above. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations of this dataset include outliers of projects that possibly intended to fund the building of venues and theaters. The breakdown of the goal is not included and omits details that would be necessary in creating a budget. The limitation of campaigns based in the United States does not provide more granular data, such as city or state, where there might be a higher concentration of backers. Popularity of plays could rise/fall based on the year and location. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
An additional bar graph could be used to highlight the campaigns that have been in Kickstarter's Spotlight to identify any correlation with the campaign's pledges and outcome. We could also utilize a bar graph to identify backers and the average donation of these campaigns.
